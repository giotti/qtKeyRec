I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
------------------------

This work borns from the research of the reverse engineers
of wifiresearchers (wifiresearchers.wordpress.com).  Using
this application, it is possible to calculate  the default
WPA  keys  used  by  the supported routers such as Telecom
Italia AGPF, Fastweb Pirelli and Fastweb Telsey.


II. INSTALL
-----------

On MS Windows you need a compiler in order to compile  the
source. You  can  use  gcc. The following are the steps to
execute for compiling the source:

1 - Download gcc from http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/

2 - Install it

3 - Extract the wirouterkeyrec's zip archive into the gcc
    directory (default is C:\MinGW)

4 - Execute Makefile_windows.bat

Now you can see the executable: wirouterkeyrec.exe

ATTENTION: the agpf_config.lst file must be always in the
same directory where is present the executable


III. HOW TO USE
---------------

Use  this  application is very simple. The simplest way is
pass the SSID(s) to the command line using the --ssid (-s)
option:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -s Alice-xxxxxxxx,FASTWEB-x-xxxxxxxxxxxx


You can load the SSID(s) also from a file:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -f essid_list_file


Or from both file and command line:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -s Alice-xxxxxxxx -f essid_list_file


The specified file content's layout must be the following:

Alice-xxxxxxxx
FASTWEB-x-xxxxxxxxxxxx


WiRouter KeyRec  will  search  the  configuration file for
AGPF  routers  first  of  all in the current directory and
after in the installation directory. The  default  file is
agpf_config.lst. You can set an alternative  configuration
file  using  the --config (-c) option:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -s Alice-xxxxxxxx -c config_file


You  can  obtain  more  information  using  the -d  and -v
options.


IV. HOW TO UPDATE THE AGPF CONFIGURATION FILE
---------------------------------------------

The  supported  router's models are reported  in the magic
number's  list  file  (default: agpf_config.lst).  You can
upgrade easly  the your own list with information found on
internet.

The  string  format  for  each Access Point's model il the
following:

"MODEL,SERIAL_PART_ONE,K CONSTANT,Q CONSTANT"

Example: "93X,69101,13,92398366,AA2F3C";

93X      = All router's models that begin with 93.
69101    = A part of the serial number.
13       = The K constant for this router's model.
92398366 = The Q constant for this router's model.
AA2F3C   = The first 3 bytes of the MAC Address Ethernet

You can replace the content of the  config.lst  to  update
the magic numbers's list.

You can use the option -u to  replace  the  content of the
configuration  file  with  the  page  specified  by the -a
option:

wirouterkeyrec.exe -a "http://www.foo.com/list.txt" -u
